I am a research assistant and PhD student in the Kramer Lab, Dept of Integrative Biology, USF. My research interests include implementing mathematical/statistical techniques to ecological data in order to understand species invasions, niche structure/ habitat suitability, and epidemiological pathways.

My current research involves environmental degradation by invasive waterfowl, Coronavirus transmission network analysis, and creating biologically informative machine learning algorithms.
