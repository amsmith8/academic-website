abstract = "Chukar partridges (Alectoris chukar) are popular game birds that have been introduced throughout the world. Propagules of varying magnitudes have been used to try and establish populations into novel locations, though the relationship between propagule size and species establishment remains speculative. Previous qualitative studies argue that site-level factors are of importance when determining where to release Chukar. We utilized machine learning ensembles to evaluate bioclimatic and topographic data from native and naturalized regions to produce predictive species distribution models (SDMs) and evaluate the relationship between establishment and site-level factors for the conterminous United States. Predictions were then compared to a distribution map based on recorded occurrences to determine model prediction performance. SDM predictions scored an average of 88% accuracy and suitability favored states where Chukars were successfully introduced and are present. Our study shows that the use of quantitative models in evaluating environmental variables and that site-level factors are strong indicators of habitat suitability and species establishment."
