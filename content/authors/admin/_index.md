I am a quantitative ecologist with a specialization in disease and wildlife challenges. I recently completed my Ph.D. the  [University of South Florida-Department of Integrative Biology (USF-IB)](https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/departments/ib/), where I was a member of the in the [Kramer Lab](https://kramera3.github.io). My research focuses on applying mathematical and statistical methods to ecological data to explore species invasions, niche structure and habitat suitability, as well as epidemiological pathways.

My dissertation, titled "Species Distribution Modeling with Environmental Time Series Data and Deep Learning", explores the application of deep learning models using time series data to classify species distributions and assess habitat suitability. Current research projects I am involved in include examining the environmental impact of introduced game birds, analyzing Coronavirus transmission networks, and developing biologically informative machine learning algorithms.

Before my time at USF, I earned both my Bachelor's in Mathematics (2013) and Master's in Interdisciplinary Ecology (2018) from the University of Florida (Go Gators!). During my undergraduate studies, I focused on applied analysis, along with secondary education and curriculum theory. For my Master's thesis, I researched the success and failures of introduced Galliformes, particularly the Alectoris chukar (chukar partridge).

Aside from academia, I am interested in biking, hiking, and all things outdoors.  I am a lead Bird of Prey handler and community educator at [Boyd Hill Nature Preserve](https://friendsofboydhillnaturepreserve.wildapricot.org) in St. Petersburg, FL.  I am also actively involved in the Florida craft beer community, and a founding member of [Cypress & Grove Brewing Co.](https://www.cypressandgrove.com/home) in Gainesville, FL .
