I am a quantitative ecologist interested in disease and wildlife issues. I recently completed my Ph.D. the  [University of South Florida-Department of Integrative Biology (USF-IB)](https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/departments/ib/), where I was a member of the  the [Kramer Lab](https://kramera3.github.io). My research focuses on applying mathematical and statistical methods to ecological data to explore species invasions, niche structure and habitat suitability, as well as epidemiological pathways.

I recently completed my dissertation, titled "[Species Distribution Modeling with Environmental Time Series Data and Deep Learning](https://digitalcommons.usf.edu/etd/10682/)", which explores the application of deep learning models to evaluate temporal patterns within environmental data to classify species distributions and assess habitat suitability. Other current research projects I am involved in include examining the environmental impact of introduced game birds, and developing biologically informative machine learning algorithms.

Before my time at USF, I earned both my Bachelor's in Mathematics (2013) and Master's in Interdisciplinary Ecology (2018) from the University of Florida (Go Gators!). During my undergraduate studies, I focused on applied analysis, along with secondary education and curriculum theory. For my Master's thesis, I researched the success and failures of introduced Galliformes, particularly the Alectoris chukar (chukar partridge).

Aside from academia, I am interested in biking, hiking, and all things outdoors.  I am a lead Bird of Prey handler and community educator at [Boyd Hill Nature Preserve](https://friendsofboydhillnaturepreserve.wildapricot.org) in St. Petersburg, FL.  I am also actively involved in the Florida craft beer community, and original crew member and taproom manager of [Cypress & Grove Brewing Co.](https://www.cypressandgrove.com/home) in Gainesville, FL.
