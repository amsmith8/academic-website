Hello World!  My name is is Austin, and welcome to my academic webpage! This is my [much delayed] first post, but to keep it short, I am an ecologist with a passion for analysis. Please navigate my page to learn more about me, my colleagues, and projects.  I will continue to update my webpage as new material are produced, and to share some of my academic and personal endeavors. I hope you enjoy!
