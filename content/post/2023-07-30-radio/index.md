title: 'Boyd Hill Nature Preserve highlight on the local news'
---

I had the privilege of introducing Sal, the resident crested caracara (*Caracara plancus*) and teaching ambassador of the Bird of Prey aviary at Boyd Hill Nature Preserve in St. Petersburg, FL to local news network, Bay News 9. Boyd Hill Nature Preserve is a 245-acre, award-winning property that offers six miles of trails and boardwalks through a variety of habitats. These include hardwood hammocks, sand pine scrub, pine flatwoods, willow marsh, swamp woodlands, and lakeshores. As a designated preserve, it serves as a sanctuary for local flora and fauna, providing critical habitat for diverse species. The session can be found [here](https://baynews9.com/fl/tampa/news/2023/09/14/boyd-hill-nature-preserve-offers-a-look-at-the-flora-and-fauna-florida-s-ecosystems-with-guided-walking-tours--tram-tours--kayak-tours--primitive-camping) (date: 2023-09-14)
