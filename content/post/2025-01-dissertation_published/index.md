My dissertation, titled "Species Distribution Modeling with Environmental Time Series Data and Deep Learning", is official published and ready to read! Completing this (and the whole Ph.D. experience) is arguably one of the greatest achievements I've done and I'm very proud of the outcome. I hope it provides insight to whomever read it...enjoy!
